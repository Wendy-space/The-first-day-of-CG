# The-first-day-of-CG
**Record** my  CG learning journey and  daily progress.
**Date**:2025/12/27

## Learning Content
  1. Installed Visual Studio sucessfully, but the environment development has not been configured yet.
  2. Watched two lectures by Games Yan Lingqi(Games 101):
     -The first lecture was an overview of computer graphics,where I took some simple notes;
     -The second was a review of linear algebra and analytic geometry,which felt easy for me with my math background, so I just read through the full notes I found online instead of taking my own.
 ## Career Planning
 -As a math major, I aim to become a CG engineer.
   1.**Target cities**: Shengzhen(1st choice)&Hangzhou(2nd choice)
 (avoid Beijing/Shanghai for less competition)
   2.**Expected salary**:15k-25k RMB.
   3.**Plan**: Build & polish CG projects in 3-4 months to compensate for non-top undergrad background & zero work experience.
 -Confirmed my interim goal through discussions with AI.
